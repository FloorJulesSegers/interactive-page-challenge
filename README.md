# interactive-page-challenge

## Instructions
- Learn to work together with a frontend designer and a frontend programmer
(I was the front-end programmer and had to work on this project with a front-end designer)

- Learn how to add interactivity with JS without altering HTML code or use JS to add to the document
- Learn how to interact with designers / template designers
- Make reusable widgets7

## Mission
We need a one-page website that promotes a local event. You can freely choose the theme of the event (party, sports, boardgames, becodeLanParty, ...).

Make a layout where users have the following parts:

- A photo slider at the top, with a left and right arrow people can navigate between them
- A container with 3 tabs (summary, practical info, contact form)
- A section with some numbers about the event, they should start counting from 1, until a final value has been reached (eg: number of expected visitors)

## Requierd features
### JS
- Make a photo slider that manages ANY number of photos, it changes pictures every 3 seconds, but you can also navigate with arrows. At the end of the last picture, start again.
- Make a tab system that hides all tabs expect the first one, then when a user clicks a button on top, make that part visible, hide the other tabcontent.
- Make the numbers in the bottom interactive, on page load they should start at 1 and then count upwards until they reach the value in the HTML document. Find a speed that makes it visually appealing.
- Disable the send button on the contact form, unless all fields have been filled in .
